	Welcome to Competitive Programming! ðŸ‘‹ Our training sessions will officially

	solving some problems by yourself!
</ProblemGroup>

<ProblemGroup problemGroup={w1} solutions={data.solutions}>
	Thanks for coming to the first session! ðŸŽ‰ Today, you will mainly get to know
	<a href="https://codeforces.com" target="_blank">Codeforces</a>
	and <a href="https://cses.fi/problemset" target="_blank">CSES</a>, two popular
	online judges for competitive programming that we will be using this semester.
	It is also highly encouraged to solve the problems using C++ and getting used
	to it if you are not quite familiar with the language yet. Have fun! ðŸ™‚
